A recipe is probably the smartest and most efficent way of making something. A set of instructions telling us
what to do and how to do it. A recipe is not repeated and is unique for the dish it is for. It will provide 
everything you need to know about the dish and all the ingredients you need. Recipes have become more and more 
advanced over time as chefs have learned to refine their culinary skills.

The very first recipe for cake was very broad and not detailed. However the recipes are now more detailed and even
someone who has never baked before could follow one and bake a fantasic cake.

<p>the ancient Egyptians were the first culture to exhibit baking skills, 
and during Ancient Times the cakes were more bread-like in appearance 
and sweetened with honey. The Greeks also had an early form of cheesecake, 
while the Romans developed versions of fruitcakes with raisins, nuts and other fruits.</p>
