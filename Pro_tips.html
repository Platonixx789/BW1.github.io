	<ul>
	 <li><font color="Rosybrown"><i>Cake flour</i></font>
    <br>Use cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.
        All-purpose flour tends to make the cake dense
        so using cake flour will give lighter and airy cakes.
        Cake flour makes the cake airy as it contains corn starch.
        To substitute you can add 90gm of apf and 30gm of corn starch.
 
<li><font color="Rosybrown"><i>Butter & Oil</i></font>
<br>A good rule of thumb is to replace about 3/4 of the butter in a recipe with olive, 
canola, or vegetable oil (if the recipe calls for 1 cup butter, use ¾ cup oil). 
You can use a 1:1 ratio when it comes to coconut oil.

<li><font color="Rosybrown"><i>Room Temp.</i></font>
<br>When a recipe calls for room temperature ingredients, 
it’s important to comply. Cold butter cannot be creamed, 
and cold eggs can shock and curdle a batter. It’s best to 
leave ingredients on the countertop overnight

<li><font color="Rosybrown"><i>Measuring Properly</i></font>
<br>Of all the baking tips, this is the number one most important rule in baking! 
Ideally, you should weigh your ingredients on a digital scale but if you don’t 
have one, the proper way to measure dry ingredients is using the spoon and 
level method: spoon the ingredients into a dry measuring cup and level or “sweep” 
the top with a straight edge. This might seem nit-picky but it’s important.
